Bob stared at his phone, reading Alice's message for the third time. She had done it. She had actually gone through with it.

He leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight. His office overlooked the Manchester skyline, but he barely noticed the view anymore. It had become just another backdrop to his daily routine.

But Alice's decision changed everything.

He picked up his phone and started typing a response, then deleted it. What could he say? Congratulations? Good luck? Those words felt hollow, inadequate for the magnitude of what she had done.

Instead, he stood up and walked to the window. The city sprawled before him, thousands of lives intersecting, each person fighting their own battles, making their own choices.

Maybe it was time for him to make his own.
