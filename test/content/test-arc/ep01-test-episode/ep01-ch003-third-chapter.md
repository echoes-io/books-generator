The morning after felt surreal. Alice woke up in her small London flat, sunlight streaming through the curtains she had forgotten to close. For a moment, she lay there, disoriented, before the events of yesterday came flooding back.

She had done it. She had really done it.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Bob: "Coffee? We need to talk."

Alice smiled. Of course they needed to talk. There was so much to discuss, so many plans to make. But for now, in this quiet moment before the day truly began, she allowed herself to simply feel.

Relief. Excitement. Terror. Hope.

All of it swirling together in a cocktail of emotions that made her feel more alive than she had in years.

She reached for her phone and typed back: "Same place as always. 10am?"

The response came immediately: "See you there."
